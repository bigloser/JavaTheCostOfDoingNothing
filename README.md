This code is to resurrect a presentation done by Dean Yu and Joshua Blatt at JavaOne several years ago.
The title was something similiar to the cost of doing nothing, and reflected how much does 
it cost to make a single JNI call.

With JMH we can do far better micro-benchmarking, so I've resurrected this.

To execute the code:

java -Djava.library.path=target/native/x86_64-darwin-clang/ -jar target/jmhtest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.yahoo.jmh.jmhtest.JavaTest 

java -Djava.library.path=target/native/x86_64-darwin-clang/ -jar target/jmhtest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.yahoo.jmh.jmhtest.JNITest 


Notice the library dir is:
target/native/x86_64-{darwin,linux}-{clang,gcc}

depending on build OS.
